DOXYGEN Version 0.49-990425

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIX:
-----------------------------------

1.  Unpack the archive, unless you already have:
   
    gunzip doxygen-0.49-990425.src.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
    tar xf doxygen-0.49-990425.src.tar       # unpack it

2.  Make sure Qt is installed properly (check the environment variable $QTDIR)

    Note: on some systems (like FreeBSD) it is possible that qt is not
    installed in one single directory. In this case I suggest to create a 
    local qt directory to which the QTDIR variable should point. Then
    create two links in that directory like this:
      ln -s <location_of_the_qt_includes> include
      ln -s <location_of_the_qt_libs> lib

3.  Look at the first two entries of Makefile.config and modify them if needed.
    Note: Doxygen requires GNU make to build. On some systems this is 
    known as gmake. If you have such a system, you must edit Makefile.config
    and replace make by gmake in rest of this document.

4.  Compile the program.

    Type:
      
      make

    You'll see a list of all supported platforms/compiler combinations.
    
    To build for the Linux platform with g++ as the compiler for example, type:
 
      make linux-g++

    The program should compile without problems and three binaries (doxygen,
    doxytag, and doxysearch) should be available in the bin directory of the 
    distribution.

5.  Generate the user manual.
    
    type:
   
      make docs

    to let doxygen generate the HTML and LaTeX documentation.
    (you will need the stream editor `sed' for this)

    type:
   
      make ps

    to generate a postscript version of the manual. 
    (you will need latex and dvips for this)

    The html directory of the distribution will now contain the html 
    documentation (just point a HTML browser to the file index.html in the 
    html directory).
    
    The postscript manual doxygen_manual.ps will be located in the latex
    directory of the distribution. Just send it to a postscript printer to 
    print it or use ghostview to view it. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS:
--------------------------------------

Currently, only Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0 is supported. For other
platforms you may need to edit the Makefiles a bit. Let me know what you
had to change if you got Doxygen working with another windows compiler. 

You will need to install the windows/dos versions of following tools:
- Perl 5.0+
- flex (you can use the DJGPP version)
- bison (you can use the DJGPP version, but you need to copy 
         lib\bison.sim to c:\djgpp\lib\bison.simple and
         lib\bison.hai to c:\djgpp\lib\bison.hairy.
         The paths seem to be hardcoded in the executable)
- Qt (Hint: only the tools section is required, so you can use the free 
      X-windows version as well!)
- Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0, use the vcvars32.bat to set the environment
  variables.

Make sure all tools are accessible from the command-line.

Open a dos box, goto the doxygen root dir and type:

make.bat

This should build the executables doxygen.exe, doxytag.exe, and doxysearch.exe
(The compiler should not produce any warnings or errors).

To build the examples type:

nmake -f Makefile.windows examples

KNOWN CONFIGURATION PROBLEMS

LATEX RELATED PROBLEMS:

- the LaTeX translation of HTML tables doesn't seem to work for all 
  compilers. It is known to work for teTeX (versions 0.4 and 0.9)
- the file a4wide.sty is not available for all distributions. If
  your distribution does not have it please select another paper type
  in the config file (see PAPER_TYPE)
- the file fancyheader.sty is known as fancyhdr.sty on some systems.
  Please change that in src/latexgen.cpp

HP-UX PROBLEMS:
- If you are compiling for HP-UX with aCC and you get this error:
    /opt/aCC/lbin/ld: Unsatisfied symbols:
    alloca (code)
  then you should edit ce_parse.cpp and replace
    extern "C" {
      void *alloca (unsigned int);
    };
  with
    #include <alloca.h>  
  This seems to be a problem with bison, but I don't know how to fix it.

That's it!
