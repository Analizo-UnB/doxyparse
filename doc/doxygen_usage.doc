/*! \page doxygen_usage Doxygen usage

Doxygen is a command line based utility.  Calling \c doxygen with the
\c -h option at the command line will give you a brief description of the 
usage of the program.

All options consist of a leading character <tt>-</tt>, 
followed by one character and optionally an argument.

To generate a class browser you typically need to follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> You document your source code with 
     special documentation blocks.
<li> You generate a configuration file (see section \ref config) by 
     calling doxygen with the \c -g option:
\verbatim
doxygen -g <config_file>
\endverbatim
<li> You edit the configuration file so it matches your project.
     In the configuration file you can specify the input files and
     a lot of optional information.
<li> You let doxygen generate the documentation, based on the settings in the
     configuration file:
\verbatim
doxygen <config_file>
\endverbatim
</ol>

If you also want a search engine to be generated, you should look
at section \ref doxysearch_usage.
