/*! \page doxywizard_usage Doxywizard usage

Doxywizard is a GUI front-end for creating and editing 
configuration files that are used by doxygen. 

Doxywizard consists of a single executable that, when started, 
pops up a window. 

The main window has a number of tab field, one
for each section in the configuration file. Each tab-field
contains a number of lines, one for each configuration option in
that section. 

The kind of input widget depends on the type of the configuration option. 
<ul>
<li>For each boolean option (those options that are answered with YES or 
    NO in the configuration file) there is a check-box. 
<li>For items taking one of a fixed set of values (like 
    \ref cfg_output_language "OUTPUT_LANGUAGE") a combo box is used.
<li>For items taking an integer value from a range, a spinbox is used.
<li>For free form string-type options there is a one line edit field
<li>For options taking a lists of strings, a one line edit field is 
    available, with a `+' button to add this string to the list and 
    a `-' button to remove the selected string from the list. There 
    is also a button with a circular "refresh" arrow that, when pressed, 
    replaces the selected item in the list with the string entered in the 
    edit field. 
<li>For file and folder entries, there are special buttons 
    that start a file dialog.
</ul>
