<ol>
<li><b>How do get information on the index page in HTML?</b>
<p>
You should use the \\mainpage command inside a comment block like this:
\verbatim
/*! \mainpage My Personal Index Page
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This is the introduction.
 *
 * \section install Installation
 *
 * \subsection step1 Step 1: Opening the box
 *  
 * etc...
 */
\endverbatim

<li><b>How can I avoid that some code fragment is parsed by Doxyen?</b>
<p>
You can use Doxygen's preprocessor for this: 
If you put
\verbatim
#ifndef DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS

 /* code that must be skipped by Doxygen */

#endif /* DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS */
\endverbatim
around the blocks that should be hidden and put:
\verbatim
  PREDEFINED = DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS
\endverbatim
in the config file then all blocks should be skipped by Doxygen as long
as <code>PREPROCESSING = YES</code>.

<li><b>How can I make doxygen ignore nasty macro's? </b>

Look at section \ref preprocessing for the answer.

</ol>
