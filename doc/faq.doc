/*! \page faq Frequently Asked Questions

<ol>
<li><b>How do get information on the index page in HTML?</b>
<p>
There is no real support for title pages at the moment. But you can
override the default index page, by using the following comment block:
\verbatim
/*! \page index My Personal Index Page
 *
 * This is my index personal index page.
 */
\endverbatim

<li><b>How can I avoid that some code fragment is parsed by Doxyen?</b>
<p>
You can use Doxygen's preprocessor for this: 
If you put
\verbatim
#ifndef DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS

 /* code that must be skipped by Doxygen */

#endif /* DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS */
\endverbatim
around the blocks that should be hidden and put:
\verbatim
  PREDEFINED = DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS
\endverbatim
in the config file then all blocks should be skipped by Doxygen as long
as <code>PREPROCESSING = YES</code>.
</ol>
