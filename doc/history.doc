<li>Support for templates and namespaces.
<li>Internationalization support. Currently supported languages are:
    English, Czech, German, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian, Japanse,
    Dutch, and Swedish. 
<li>Automatic generation of inheritance diagrams for sub & super classes.
<li>Support for man page, compressed HTML help, and hyperlinked PDF output.
<li>Cross-referencing documentation with source code and source inlining.
<li>LaTeX formulas can be included in the documentation.
<li>Support for parsing Corba & Microsoft IDL.
<li>Images can be included in the documentation.
<li>Improved parsing & preprocessing.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.4</h3>

<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>LaTeX output generation.
<li>Full JavaDoc support. 
<li>Build-in C-preprocessor for correct conditional parsing of source code
    that is read by Doxygen.
<li>Build-in HTML to LaTeX converter. This allows you to use HTML tags in
    your documentation, while doxygen still generates proper LaTeX output.
<li>Many new commands (there are now more than 60!) to document
    more entities, to make the documentation look nicer, and to include 
    examples or pieces of examples.
<li>Enum types, enum values, typedefs, #defines, and files can now be 
    documented.
<li>Completely new documentation, that is now generated by Doxygen.
<li>A lot of small examples are now included.
</ul>
<h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A lot of parser bugs are fixed.
<li>Improved support for documenting C code.
</ul> 

<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A search engine <a href="doxysearch_usage.html">doxysearch</a>, 
    that allows you to search through the generated documentation.
<li>A configuration file instead of command-line options. A default 
    configuration file can be generated 
    by <a href="doxygen_usage.html">doxygen</a>.
<li>Added an option to generate output for undocumented classes.
<li>Added an option to generate output for private members.
<li>Every page now contains a condensed index page, allowing much faster 
    navigation through the documentation.
<li>Global and member variables can now be documented.
<li>A project name can now given, which will be included in the

<li>The list of all members now also contains the undocumented members.
<li>Special documentation is now removed from code blocks.
<li>Doxygen should compile on Sun Solaris (with <code>CC</code>), HP-UX (with 
    <code>CC</code>), Irix (with DCC) and Linux (with <code>GCC</code>)
<li>Fixed several minor bugs.
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<h4>New features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Blocks of code are now parsed. Function calls and variables are
    replaced by links to their documentation if possible.
<li>Special example documentation block added. This can be used to
    provide cross references between the documentation and some example code.
<li>Documentation blocks can now be placed inside the body of a class.
<li>Documentation blocks with line range may now be created using 
    special <code>//!</code> C++ line comments.
<li>Unrelated members can now be documented. A page containing a
    list of these members is generated.
<li>Added an <code>\include</code> command to insert blocks of source code
    into the documentation.
<li>Warnings are generated for members that are undocumented.
<li>You can now specify your own HTML headers and footers for the
    generated pages.
<li>Option added to generated indices containing all external classes
    instead of only the used ones.
</ul>

<h4>Bug fixes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a link generation problem with mixed case filenames are used.
<li>Made doxygen a little more portable. 
    (doxygen should now compile on Linux (with g++) and HP-UX (with CC))
<li>Fixed a bug in err() function.
<li>Fixed a problem with the type cast operator.
<li>Removed some typo's from the docs.
<li>Several small bug fixes and enhancements.
</ul>
