<h2>Introduction</h2>
Doxygen is a documentation system for C and C++. It can generate an on-line 
class browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual 
(in \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$) from a set 
of documented source files. The documentation is extracted directly from the 
sources. Doxygen is developed on a <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> 
platform, but it runs on most other UNIX flavors as well. 
An executable for Windows 95/NT is also available.

Doxygen can also be configured to extract the code-structure from undocumented
source files. This can be very useful to quickly find your way in large
source distributions.

You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did
for this manual).

This manual is divided into two parts, each of which is divided into several 
sections.

The first part forms a user manual:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref install discusses how to download, compile and install
                     doxygen for your platform.
<li>Section \ref starting tells you how to generate your first piece of 
                     documentation quickly. 
<li>Section \ref trouble tells you what to do when you have problems.
</ul>

The second part forms a reference manual:

<ul>
<li>Section \ref features presents an overview of what Doxygen can do.
<li>Section \ref history shows what has changed during the development 
                 of Doxygen and what still has to be done.
<li>Section \ref doxygen_usage shows how to use the \c doxygen program.
<li>Section \ref doxytag_usage shows how to use the \c doxytag program.
<li>Section \ref doxysearch_usage shows how to use the \c doxysearch program. 
<li>Section \ref installdox_usage shows how to use the \c installdox
                 script that is generated by Doxygen if you use tag files. 
<li>Section \ref autolink shows how to put links to files, classes, 
                 and members in the documentation.
<li>Section \ref config shows how to fine-tune doxygen, so it 
              generates the documentation you want.
<li>Section \ref commands shows an overview of the special commands that can be 
              used within the documentation.
<li>Section \ref htmlcmds shows an overview of the HTML commands that
              can be used within the documentation.
</ul>

Thanks go to:

<li>Malte Z&ouml;ckler and Roland Wunderling, authors of Doc++.
    The first version of Doxygen was based on an old version of Doc++. 
    Although I have rewritten practically all code since then, Doc++ has still 
    given me a good start in writing Doxygen.
<li>All people at Troll Tech, for creating a beautiful GUI Toolkit.
    (which is even useful for GUI-less applications like doxygen :-)
<li>My brother <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~fidget/index.html">Frank</a>
    for rendering the logos.
