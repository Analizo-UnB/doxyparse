/*! \page install Installation

\addindex installation
First go to the 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html">download</a> page
\latexonly({\tt http://www.stack.nl/$\sim$dimitri/doxygen/download.html})\endlatexonly
to get the latest distribution and unpack it.

If you downloaded the source distribution, you need at least the 
following to build the executable:
<UL>
<LI>Troll Tech's GUI toolkit <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/dl">Qt</A>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.troll.no/dl})\endlatexonly.
    \addindex Qt
<LI>The <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">GNU</a> tools 
    flex, bison and make
    \addindex flex
    \addindex bison
    \addindex make
<LI>In order to generate a Makefile for your platform, you need 
    <a href="http://www.perl.com>perl</a>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.perl.com})\endlatexonly.
    \addindex perl
</UL>
For platform specific installation instructions see the \c INSTALL file
that is included in the package.

\addindex HTTP
\addindex CGI
To use the search engine \c doxysearch, you will also need
a HTTP daemon running on the target system and permission to execute a 
CGI binary.

If you are running Unix, and have Qt installed correctly, you can simply enter
\verbatim
configure
\endverbatim
to set up the makefiles for your platform. For Windows this step can be
skipped.

To override the auto detected platform you can specify
\verbatim
configure --platform platform-type
\endverbatim
See the file \c PLATFORMS for a list of possible platforms. 
For more configuration options use <code>configure --help</code>

To compile and link the sources enter
\verbatim
make
\endverbatim
in the root of the distribution.
Doxygen should compile without errors or warnings.
If it does not, please send the compilation errors or warnings along 
with a description of your platform to 
<a href="mailto:dimitri@stack.nl>dimitri@stack.nl</a>.

After compilation, the binaries will be located in the \c bin
directory of the distribution.
You may want to copy these files to a location in your path 
(\c /usr/local/bin for instance) or add the \c bin
directory of the distribution to your search path.

On Unix you can also type:
\verbatim
make install
\endverbatim

The following binaries should now be available:
<UL>
<LI>\c doxygen: for generating the class browser. 
<LI>\c doxytag: for creating a tag file containing references 
    to external documentation.
<LI>\c doxysearch: the search engine. This binary should not be 
    executed directly. It must be called from an CGI script that will be 
    generated by doxygen. 
</UL>

To take full advantage of doxygen's features the following additional
tools should be installed.

<ul>
<li>\f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$:
    <a href="http://www.tug.org">teTeX 1.0</a> (for Unix) or 
    <a href="ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/systems/win32/web2c/fptex-0.3/">fpTeX 0.3</a> (for Windows)<br>
    Needed for LaTeX and PDF output.
<li><a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">
    the Graph visualization toolkit version 1.5</a><br>
    Needed for the include dependency graphs, the graphical inheritance graphs,
    and the collaboration graphs.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> For windows you will have to set the <code>DOTFONTPATH</code> environment 
    variable to include the current directory (e.g. <code>DOTFONTPATH=.</code>)
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/htmlhelp">
    the HTML help workshop</a> (for Windows only)<br>
    Needed for compiling compressed HTML output (a.k.a. the new Windows help format).
</ul>

Doxygen was developed and tested under Linux using the following tools:
<ul>
<li>EGCS version 2.91.66
<li>GNU flex version 2.5.4
<li>GNU bison version 1.25
<li>GNU make version 3.76.1
<li>Perl version 5.005_02 
<li>VIM version 5.4
<li>Netscape 4.61
<li>Troll Tech's tmake version 1.3 (included in the distribution) 
<li>teTeX version 0.9
<li>CVS 1.10.7
</ul>
