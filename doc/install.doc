/*! \page install Installation

\addindex installation
First go to the 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html">download</a> page
\latexonly({\tt http://www.stack.nl/$\sim$dimitri/doxygen/download.html})\endlatexonly
to get the latest distribution and unpack it.

If you downloaded the source distribution, you need at least the 
following to build the executable:
<UL>
<LI>Troll Tech's GUI toolkit <A HREF="http://www.troll.no/dl">Qt</A>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.troll.no/dl})\endlatexonly.
    \addindex Qt
<LI>The <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">GNU</a> tools 
    flex, bison and make
    \latexonly(see {\tt ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu})\endlatexonly.
    \addindex flex
    \addindex bison
    \addindex make
<LI>In order to generate a Makefile for your platform, you need 
    <a href="http://www.perl.com>perl</a>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.perl.com})\endlatexonly.
    \addindex perl
</UL>

\addindex HTTP
\addindex CGI
To use the search engine \c doxysearch, you will also need
a HTTP daemon running on the target system and permission to execute a 
CGI binary.

Once you have Qt installed correctly, you can simply enter:
\verbatim
make
\endverbatim
to get a list of all supported platforms/compilers.
Typing <tt>make</tt> followed by your platform will compile doxygen.
For Linux you can enter the following:
\verbatim
make linux-g++
\endverbatim

Doxygen should compile without errors or warnings.
If it does not, please send the compilation errors or warnings along 
with a description of your platform to 
<a href="mailto:dimitri@stack.nl>dimitri@stack.nl</a>.

After compilation, the binaries will be located in the \c bin
directory of the distribution.
You may want to copy these files to a location in your path 
(\c /usr/local/bin for instance) or add the \c bin
directory of the distribution to your search path.

The following binaries should now be available:
<UL>
<LI>\c doxygen: for generating the class browser. 
<LI>\c doxytag: for creating a tag file containing references 
    to external documentation.
<LI>\c doxysearch: the search engine. This binary should not be 
    executed directly. It must be called from an CGI script that will be 
    generated by doxygen. 
</UL>

Doxygen was developed and tested under Linux using the following tools:
<ul>
<li>EGCS version 2.91.66
<li>GNU flex version 2.5.4
<li>GNU bison version 1.25
<li>GNU make version 3.76.1
<li>Perl version 5.005_02 
<li>VIM version 5.4
<li>Netscape 4.04 & 4.5
<li>Troll Tech's tmake version 1.2 (included in the distribution) 
<li>teTeX version 0.9
</ul>
