/*! \page lists Lists

Doxygen has a number of ways to create lists of items.

<b>Using dashes</b>

     By putting a number of column-aligned minus signs at the start of a 
     line, a bullet list will automatically be generated. 
     Numbered lists can also be generated by using a minus followed by a hash.
     Nesting of lists is allowed.<p>
     Here is an example:
\verbatim
  /*! 
   *  A list of events:
   *    - mouse events
   *         -# mouse move event
   *         -# mouse click event\n
   *            More info about the click event.
   *         -# mouse double click event
   *    - keyboard events
   *         -# key down event
   *         -# key up event
   *
   *  More text here.
   */
\endverbatim
     The result will be:

     A list of events:
       - mouse events
            -# mouse move event
            -# mouse click event\n
               More info about the click event.
            -# mouse double click event
       - keyboard events
            -# key down event
            -# key up event
     
     More text here.

If you use tabs within lists, please make sure that \ref cfg_tab_size "TAB_SIZE" in the 
configuration file is set to the correct tab size.

<b>Using HTML commands</b>

If you like you can also use HTML commands inside the documentation
blocks. Using these commands has the advantage that it is more natural
for list items that consists of multiple paragraphs. 

Here is the above example with HTML commands:
\verbatim
  /*! 
   *  A list of events:
   *  <ul>
   *  <li> mouse events
   *     <ol>
   *     <li>mouse move event
   *     <li>mouse click event\n
   *         More info about the click event.
   *     <li>mouse double click event
   *     </ol>
   *  <li> keyboard events
   *     <ol>     
   *     <li>key down event
   *     <li>key up event
   *     </ol>
   *  </ul>
   *  More text here.
   */
\endverbatim

\note The indentation here is not important.

<b>Using \\arg or \@li</b>

For compatibility with the Troll Tech's internal documentation tool and
with KDoc, doxygen has two commands that can be used to create simple
unnested lists. 

See \ref cmdarg "\arg" and \ref cmdli "\li" for more info.
