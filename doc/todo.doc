/*! \page todo Doxygen TODO's

<h3>TODO/Wish list</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expand namespaces in the file docs with the contents that are
    specific to the file (maybe also expand the classes inside a namespace). 
<li>Add support for grouping members, and document then as a group.
<li>Support for K&R-style function arguments.
<li>More output formats: suggested are info format and RTF format.
<li>Split long lists in an index to a set of smaller lists.
<li>Add a nice graphical front-end for creating and modifying the 
    configuration file (it should be flexible enough to quickly add new options).
<li>Improve the search index generation, so it uses less memory and
    is easier to get running.
<li>Generate code metrics (Anyone know a good book about code metrics?)
<li>Add features that you think are missing... So if you know any that are
    not yet listed here, please let me know.
</ul>
