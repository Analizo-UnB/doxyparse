/*! \page trouble Troubleshooting

<h2>Known problems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Doxygen is <em>not</em> a real compiler, it is only a lexical scanner.
    This means that it can and will not detect errors in your source code.
<li>Since it impossible to test all possible code fragments, it is
    very well possible, that some valid piece of C/C++ code is not handled
    properly. If you find such a piece, please send it to me, so I can
    improve doxygen's parsing capabilities. Try to make the piece of code 
    you send as small as possible, to help me narrow down the search.
<li>Using declarations for member are not yet supported. 
    They are simply ignored. Using declarations for class and using 
    directives are supported however. 
<li>Doxygen does not work properly if there are multiple classes, structs
    or unions with the same name in your code. It should not crash however,
    rather it should ignore all of the classes with the same name except one.
<li>Some commands do not work inside the arguments of other commands.
    Inside a HTML link (i.e \<a href="..."\>...\<a\>) for instance 
    other commands (including other HTML commands) do not work!
    The sectioning commands are an important exception. 
<li>Redundant braces can confuse doxygen in some cases. 
    For example:
\verbatim
  void f (int);
\endverbatim
    is properly parsed as a function declaration, but
\verbatim
  const int (a);
\endverbatim
  is also seen as a function declaration with name 
  <code>int</code>, because only the syntax is analysed,
  not the semantics. If the redundant braces can be detected, as in
\verbatim
  int *(a[20]);
\endverbatim
  then doxygen will remove the braces and correctly parse the result.
<li>Not all names in code fragments that are included in the documentation
    are replaced by links (for instance when using \c SOURCE_BROWSER = \c YES). 
    This also holds for the "Referenced by" list that is generated for
    each function.

    For a part this is because the code parser isn't smart enough at the
    moment. I'll try to improve this in the future. But even with these
    improvements not everthing can be properly linked to the corresponding
    documentation, because of possible ambiguities or lack of
    information about the context in which the code fragment is found.  
<li>It is not possible to insert a non-member function f in a class A 
    using the \\relates command, if class A already has a member with name f
    and the same argument list.
<li>There is only very limited support for member specialization at the
    moment. It only works if there is a specialized template class as
    well.
<li>Not all special commands are properly translated to RTF.
</ul>


<h2>How to help</h2>
The development of Doxygen highly depends on your input! 

If you are trying Doxygen let me know what you think of it (do you
miss certain features?). Even if you decide not to use it, please let me
know why. 

<h2>How to report a bug</h2>

I would appreciate an e-mail if you have found
a bug, or if you have ideas (or even better some code or a patch) 
how to fix existing bugs and limitations. For patches please use
"diff -u" or include the files you modified. If you send more than
one file please tar or zip everything, so I only have to save and download
one file.

Always try to include the following information in your bug report: 
- The version of doxygen you are using (for instance 1.2.4).
- The name and version number of your operating system (for instance 
  SuSE Linux 6.4)
- It is usually a good idea to send along the configuation file as well, 
  but please use doxygen with the <code>-s</code> flag while generating it
  to keep it small. 
- The easiest way for me to solve bugs is if you can send me a small example
  demonstrating the problem you have. Please make sure the example is valid
  source code (could potentially compile) and that the problem is really 
  captured by the example (I often get examples that do not trigger the 
  actual bug!).

If you send only a (vague) description of a bug, you are usually not very 
helpful and it will cost me much more time to figure out what you mean. 
In the worst-case your bug report may even be completely ignored by me! 

My e-mail address: dimitri@stack.nl 

Note that you can also post bug report to the developers mailing list
or use the bug tracker at sourceforge (though I do not really like the
latter because of its web interface).
